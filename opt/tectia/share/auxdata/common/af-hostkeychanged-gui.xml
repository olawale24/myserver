@@ WARNING: SERVER HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!
@@

There are many possible reasons for this:
1. The administrator of the remote host computer has changed the host key.
2. The remote host computer is part of a server cluster.
3. SOMEONE COULD BE EAVESDROPPING ON YOU RIGHT NOW (man-in-the-middle attack)!

It is NOT RECOMMENDED to connect to the remote host computer until you have
contacted the system administrator and found out why the host identification
has changed.
 
The fingerprint of the host public key is:
"%%%HOSTKEYFINGERPRINT%%%"

You can get a public key's fingerprint by running following command
% ssh-keygen-g3 -F publickey.pub
on the key file.  You should check the validity of the host key ASAP.

If you choose to continue the connection without saving the changed
key, the following steps will be taken to ensure your privacy:
  - Agent forwarding is disabled to avoid attacks by corrupted servers.
  - X11 forwarding is disabled to avoid attacks by corrupted servers.
If you are not absolutely sure about what you are doing, choose Cancel
and contact the administrator of the server system.
