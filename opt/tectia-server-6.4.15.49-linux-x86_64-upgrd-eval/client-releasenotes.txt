1.   About This Release
-----------------------

  The 6.4 release of Tectia Client is declared feature complete and Long
  Term Supported (LTS). Therefore, it is supported for 3 years from the
  release date of 6.4.12, until October 2018. It is possible to further
  extend that support for 2 more years (until October 2020). There will
  be 6.4 maintenance releases which will fix critical bugs, but no new
  features will be added to any future 6.4 release.

  Items addressed in this release are listed under the "6.4.15" section.

  We recommend uninstalling any SSH Secure Shell and SSH Tectia 4.x products
  before installing Tectia 6.4 products.
  For the installation instructions, refer to the Tectia Server Administrator
  Manual.

2.   New Features
-----------------

The following new features have been implemented in Tectia Client:

New Features in 6.4.15
----------------------

(FB #53144)
- Windows: Added support for using environment variable DISPLAY to
  overwrite default X11 display setting. The default for display is
  ":0", and this can be changed on Windows command line by issuing
  command: "set DISPLAY=:1", for example.


New Features in 6.4.14
----------------------

(FB #47742)
- Windows: Added support for Windows Server 2016 for Tectia Client and
  Server.

(FB #48552)
- Windows: Added support for Windows 10 Anniversary Update for Tectia
  Client and Server.


New Features in 6.4.13
----------------------

(FB #40754)
- Windows: Added support for Windows 10 for Tectia Client and Server.

(FB #43071)
- AIX: IBM AIX 5.3 is no longer supported.
- Solaris: Oracle Solaris 9 is no longer supported.
- Linux: SLED 10 and 11 and SLES 9 are no longer supported.

(FB #42520)
- All platforms: Installed host key is now 2048 bits by default.

(FB #43942)
- All platforms: Default key type in key generation is now RSA by default.


New Features in 6.4.12
----------------------

(FB #39128)
- All Platforms: The key-exchange method diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 was
  removed from the Connection Broker's factory default configuration. The
  diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 KEX method uses the 1024-bit Oakley group1,
  which is small by current standards, as shown by the LogJam paper.

  The ssh-keyfetch utility uses from now on diffie-hellman-group14-sha1
  instead of group1.

(FB #38034)
- All Platforms: When 'end-point-identity-check="yes"', user logon with a
  short hostname is allowed in addition to FQDN in server authentication
  with host certificate. With a short hostname, a warning indicating the
  matched certificate is issued.

(FB #39511)
- Windows: Tectia Connections Configuration GUI now allows creation of
  keys larger than 3072 bits (up to 8192 bits).

(FB #36435)
- Windows: The Tectia Server package now includes also Tectia Client
  components. If you previously have Tectia Client installed, the Server
  installation will fold that installation in, resulting in a Server
  installation. It is possible to install the package without the client
  components. Installing Tectia ConnectSecure and Server is supported
  only if the two packages are of the same version.

(FB #37320)
- Linux: SLES 12 and SLED 12 are now officially supported platforms.

(FB #34058)
- All Platforms: The Connection Broker configuration (XML) file now has
  options for certificate validation similar to the Server: cache-size,
  max-crl-size, external-search-timeout, max-ldap-response-length, and
  ldap-idle-timeout. This allows configuring the Broker to accept very
  large CRLs, for example. No GUI support as of yet.

(FB #39932)
- Windows: Upgraded Qt to 4.8.3 and ICU to 51.2. The software is now
  built with Visual Studio 2013. The created MSI packages will require
  a Microsoft update to install on Windows 2003 and XP.

(FB #41355)
- Windows: Upgraded the OpenSSL cryptographic library used in FIPS mode
  to version 1.0.2a.


New Features in 6.4.11
----------------------

  Release 6.4.11 was z/OS specific, and there was no release for the
  rest of the platforms.


New Features in 6.4.10
----------------------

(FB #36108)
- Linux, Solaris, HP-UX(IA-64): Upgraded the OpenSSL cryptographic
  library used in FIPS mode to version 1.0.2a. HP-UX (PA-RISC) and IBM
  AIX will continue to use the OpenSSL cryptographic library version
  0.9.8.

(FB #6373)
- Windows: Added support for configuring signature algorithms in Tectia
  Connections Configuration GUI.

(FB #7588)
- All Platforms: Added support for Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellmann (ECDH) for
  key exchange and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for
  keys, host keys and X.509 certificates. The curves used are NISTP256,
  NISTP384 and NISTP521.

(FB #35758)
- All Platforms: Entrust certificates are no longer supported.


New Features in 6.4.8
---------------------

(FB #32437)
- Windows: Added support for Windows 8.1 for Tectia Client and Server.

(FB #32330)
- Linux: Added support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for Tectia Client,
  Server and ConnectSecure.

(FB #2327)
- Windows: Added an "Authentication Method" drop-down list in the Quick
  Connect dialog of Tectia SSH Terminal GUI for selecting the authentication
  method to use regardless of what is specified in the configuration.

(FB #28924)
- All Platforms: Added standard MACs hmac-sha2-256 and hmac-sha2-512 as
  specified in RFC 6668. This enables third-party compatibility when using
  SHA-2 MACs in Tectia products.

(FB #11528)
- Windows: Tectia Client now provides SHA-2 support with certificates stored
  in tokens via MSCAPI.


New Features in 6.4.7
---------------------

(FB #27820)
- Windows, Linux, Solaris, HP-UX(IA-64): Upgraded the OpenSSL cryptographic
  library used in FIPS mode to version 1.0.1e. The OpenSSL library version
  1.0.1e was compiled with -DOPENSSL_NO_HEARTBEATS. Tectia Client, Server and
  ConnectSecure use only the fipscannister object of the OpenSSL library, and
  therefore do not contain the Heartbleed vulnerability.
  HP-UX (PA-RISC) and IBM AIX will continue to use the OpenSSL cryptographic
  library version 0.9.8. This does not affect Tectia Server for Linux on IBM
  System z, as the OpenSSL library is not provided.


New Features in 6.4.6
---------------------

(FB #27640)
- Windows: Updated the certificate used for signing the Windows packages.
  Note that the new certificate uses SHA-2 to verify its signature. Microsoft
  XP with Service Pack 2 does not support SHA-2 and therefore cannot guarantee
  the integrity of the certificate (KB968730). For Microsoft Windows Server
  2003 with Service Pack 2, to validate the certificate, apply the hotfix
  to KB968730.

(FB #27934)
- Windows: Added support for Windows 2012 R2 for Tectia Client and Server.


New Features in 6.4.5
---------------------

(FB #26129)
- All Platforms: When the standard output of sftpg3/scpg3 is redirected to a
  file, it will now contain the file transfer progress percentage.

(FB #24430)
- Windows: Added support for Windows 8 for Tectia Client and Server.


New Features in 6.4.2
---------------------

(FB #19057)
- All Platforms: Added to Server authentication CA Certificate an option
  "endpoint identity check". Moreover, included options to ask, deny or accept
  a certificate if the host name does not match the certificate's host name.

(FB #21445)
- Windows: Added support for Windows 2012 for SSH Tectia Client and Server.

(FB #9607)
- Solaris 11 SPARC: New installation packages available for Oracle Solaris 11
  (SPARC).

(FB #21784)
- Solaris 11 x86-64: New installation packages available for Oracle Solaris 11
  (x86-64).


New Features in 6.4.0
---------------------

(FB #9829)
- All platforms: Added support for agent protocol versions 1 and 2 in client
  side - server side already supported it.

(FB #19421)
- All Platforms: scpg3, sftpg3 and FTP Conversion will now notify the JOBID
  when dealing with SITE Filetype=JES. Please, refer to documentation to
  obtain those JOBID with older Tectia clients or with third-party clients.

  cryptographic library version 1.0.2a is used, ssh-keygen-g3 in FIPS mode
  (--fips-mode) can now be used to generate RSA keys of length n*512,
  where 2=<n=<24 (that is 1024, 1536, 2024, ... , 11776 and 12288 bits).

(FB #36678)
- All Platforms: ssh-broker-g3 will no longer crash if it fails to read its
  configuration file because of faulty permissions.

(FB #34693)
- Windows: ssh-broker-ctl debug --log-file will always append the messages to
  the log file (the same as with the --append option). This change does not
  affect other platforms.

(FB #34712)
- All Platforms: ssh-broker-ctl will no longer busyloop when using add-crl or
  add-certificate command without specifying a file name.


Bug Fixes in 6.4.8

(FB #21081)
- All Platforms: In file transfer clients, ASCII and character set conversion
  related site commands to Tectia SSH Server for IBM z/OS now work against all
  versions of Tectia SSH Server for IBM z/OS.


Bug Fixes in 6.4.0
------------------

(FB #9829)
- All platforms: Added support for agent protocol versions 1 and 2 in client
  side - server side already supported it.

(FB #18136)
- All platforms: Broker no longer crashes when running in SOCKS proxy mode
  and falling back to plain.

(FB #13741)
- Windows: Tectia Client on Windows Command Prompt no longer ignores errors
  when sending terminal data to the server. Therefore, characters will no
  longer be lost for this reason.

(FB #16418)
- Windows: Improved the efficiency of typing commands to the Tectia Client
  on Windows Command Prompt.

(FB #20335)
- All Platforms: SSH_SFTP_CMD_GETPUT_MODE environment variable works again.

(FB #20475)
- All Platforms: The End-user license agreement (EULA) has been updated to
  reflect the new company name.

(FB #20710)
- All Platforms: Tectia Client, Server and ConnectSecure executables no longer

4.   Known Issues
-----------------
The following issues are currently known to exist in Tectia Client:

(FB #38886)
- All Platforms: scpg3 and sftpg3 with --append overwrite the destination
  file when the server is OpenSSH 6.4 or older.

(FB# 39847)
- AIX: Host-based authentication in FIPS mode requires copying or linking
  the libcrypto.a to /lib or /usr/lib.

(FB #36224, FB #36221)
- Windows: Connections Configuration GUI: Dots do not work correctly in
  profile names or profile folder names, because they are used internally
  for the profile folder feature.

(FB #36222)
- Windows: Connections Configuration GUI: Empty connection profile folders
  are not saved in the Broker configuration.

(FB #36835)
- All platforms: Remote translation tables only work when the site command
  X=BIN is used. Local translation tables work as intended.

(FB #37079)
- Windows XP, 2003 and 2003R2: Authentication using ECDSA public keys and
  certificates via MSCAPI is not supported on Windows XP, Windows Server
  2003 and Windows Server 2003R2.

(FB #19541)
- Unix/Linux: When logged to the SSH Tectia Server, an executable will fail
  to start if any parent of the current working directory is not readable
  and relative paths are used to refer to the executable.

(FB #13818)
- All Platforms: The usage of IPv6 addresses in certificates is not yet
  supported.

(FB #3882)
- z/OS: SFTP fails when attempting to transfer an empty MVS dataset. However,
  FTP opens the file and proclaims that the transfer is completed without
  generating an error.

(FB #10425)
- Unix: if OpenSSL 0.9.8 is installed on the host where Tectia Server is
  installed, it may fail when using PAM with software that uses that OpenSSL
  library.
  Workaround if FIPS is not used: Rename the libcrypto.so.0.9.8 existent under
  /opt/tectia/sshlib to another name (note that this will make FIPS mode
  unusable).

(FB #9840)
- Solaris: On some Solaris configurations the ssh-capture tool does not
  function without configuring the operating system. The runtime linking
  environment must be adjusted to honor the LD_PRELOAD environment variable.
  See the manual page of crle(1) for details.

(FB #9367)
- Windows: If the installation fails with error message "An error occurred
  during the installation of assembly component {B708EB72-AA82-3EB7-8BB0-
  D845BAB35C93D}. HRESULT: 0x80070BC9" use Windows Update to install
  required operating system updates.

(FB #9106)
- AIX: Executables are now compiled in 64 bit. For PAM to work, the operating
  system should point to the 64-bit versions of PAM libraries instead of the
  32-bit versions.

(FB #9530)
- All platforms: Extra checks are done when starting the Tectia Server and
  Connection Broker in the FIPS mode due to the OpenSSL FIPS cryptographic
  library health check. This will lead to a noticeable delay in the start of
  the process on slow machines.

(FB #7726)
- Windows: --summary-format newline option '\n' does not work on Windows.

(FB #4725)
- All platforms: The ssh-keygen will always use the default location of the
  UserConfigDirectory, if no path is specified.

(FB #4705)
- Linux SE: If the common package is installed with SElinux disabled, the
  following warning message will be given during the installation:
    /usr/bin/chcon: can't apply partial context to unlabeled file
    /opt/tectia/lib/shlib/libicudata.so.40
    /usr/bin/chcon: can't apply partial context to unlabeled file
    /opt/tectia/lib/shlib/libicuuc.so.40
  This can be safely ignored.  However, if the SElinux enforcing is enabled
  after the installation, the following command needs to be executed:
    /usr/bin/chcon -t textrel_shlib_t /opt/tectia/lib/shlib/*.so

(RQ #18958)
- Windows: Password cannot be specified in a file with --password
  command-line option.

(RQ #18674)
- Windows: Uploading files from "Upload Dialog" of the GUI file transfer
  tool does not work when "Hide extensions for known file types" of Windows
  Explorer is set to 'yes'.
  Workaround: Enable file extensions. This issue will be fixed in an
  upcoming maintenance release.

(RQ #18484)
- Windows Vista: When using an evaluation version of Tectia Client and
  trying to import a commercial license on Windows Vista, the operation will
  fail.
  Workaround: Manually copy the license file to the licenses directory
  under "%ProgramFiles%\SSH Communications Security\SSH Tectia\SSH Tectia
  AUX\licenses".

(RQ #18332)
- Windows: When upgrading from a 4.x client, the connection profiles that
  were migrated did not show up in the profile's drop-down menu on the
  terminal client.  However, after restarting the Connection Broker the
  migrated profiles will be shown on the client.

(RQ #17537)
- Windows: If the "Transparent tunneling" component of Tectia Client or
  Tectia ConnectSecure is installed on a Windows XP computer in a domain
  where firewall exceptions are managed by a group policy, the exceptions get
  changed so that the computer becomes inaccessible from the network.
  Workaround: Edit the exceptions manually so that, for example, the server
  port becomes accessible.

(RQ #17535)
- Windows: SFTP GUI might cause the existing local copy of a file to be
  partially overwritten in ASCII mode, when downloading of the file from the
  remote server fails due to missing file permissions.

(RQ #17528)
- All platforms: The scpg3 command shows the transfer time incorrectly if
  "--statistics=simple" is set.

(RQ #17482)
- All platforms: When trying to connect to a server that is not available
  (i.e. the server is not running), the error message returned by
  sshg3 is "Unable to connect to Broker". It should return "Unable to connect
  to Server".

(RQ #17368)
- Windows: Reconnecting to the previously used Connection Profile by
  pressing Enter in the Tectia Terminal or File Transfer GUI may fail in
  some cases.
  Workaround: Select the profile from the menu.

(RQ #17343)
- Windows: Removing a token while it is being read could in some cases
  result in a Tectia Connection Broker failure.

(RQ #17215)
- Windows: Opening multiple remote tunnels in a profile against OpenSSH
  servers can cause Tectia Connection Broker to fail.

(RQ #17055)
- Solaris: Installation packages do not detect the underlying Solaris
  architecture to prevent installation of the x86-64 packages on x86
  architecture. The packages can be installed but they will not work.

(RQ #16986)
- Windows: SFTP 'chmod' command is not supported against Tectia Server
  running on Windows.

(RQ #16902)
- Unix: If scpg3 is used to copy a file to itself, the file will be
  truncated and the scpg3 command hangs.

(RQ #16573)
- Unix: The 'finger' command does not show the idle time correctly when
  logged in using SFTP.

(RQ #16276)
- Windows: When running sftpg3 in batch mode, the Connection Broker may log
  the Broker_channel_process_exit_failed messages with status "Operation
  failed". These are system internal events and do not indicate any failure
  in the file transfer operation.

(RQ #16270)
- Windows: The exit values for scpg3 do not match the values mentioned in
  the documentation in the following error situations: connection lost,
  interrupting a file transfer using CTRL+C, trying to copy to a directory, but
  the destination is not a directory. Nevertheless, in all these cases the
  return value is non-zero.

(RQ #15996)
- All platforms: scpg3 does not warn about the existence of directories
  when shell globbing is used, for example:
  scpg3 "/tmp/testdir/*" user@server:/tmp
  However, the correct warning is displayed if the scpg3 command is used
  without globbing:
  scpg3 /tmp/testdir/* user@server:/tmp

(RQ #15973)
- All platforms: The certificate validation path construction from LDAP
  fails, if the LDAP server requires suffix ';binary' for the PKI binary blob
  attribute names.

(RQ #15948)
- Windows: If the Connection Broker is started for another userID using the
  'runas' command, the user dialogs are shown for the user who started the
  process.

(RQ #15921)
- All platforms: The server creates empty files if a user tries to transfer
  files without correct server-side permissions. The correct error message is
  displayed.

(RQ #15846)
- Windows: Local TCP tunneling using listener port 0 does not work.

(RQ #15006)
- Windows: When accessing a Unix host using scpg3 or sftpg3, files with file
  names that contain characters that are illegal in Windows file names (for
  example: *, ? and ~) cannot be transferred or accessed if relative paths
  are used.
  Workaround: Use absolute paths for accessing the files on the Unix host
  and escape the illegal characters with the tilde character '~'. Note also
  that the files with illegal characters need to be renamed when transferred
  to Windows. For example, to copy a file "file*name.txt" from user's Unix
  home directory to Windows:
  C:\> scpg3.exe user@server:/home/user/file~*name.txt filename.txt

(RQ #14227)
- Windows: If trying to connect from a Windows GUI client to an OpenSSH
  server with a public key and option command="ls", the client hangs. When
  performed with the Windows command-line client (sshg3) it works properly.

(RQ #14226)
- Windows: When using regular expressions in filter rules the dot character
  '.' does not work as expected. For example, when using a filter rule for
  tunneling of telnet.exe using regular expression: '.*.ssh.com' the
  connection will not be tunneled even if the regular expression matched the
  host address.
  Workaround: Add a '\' in front of the '.' For example, the previous
  regular expression should be:  '.*\.ssh\.com'

(RQ #14222)
- All platforms: If a wrong passphrase is provided several times for a key,
  the Connection Broker skips it and proceeds to the next key. If it is an
  OpenSSH key, once it has been skipped because of a decoding failure, the
  Connection Broker makes no further attempts to use the key on subsequent
  login attempts. The Connection Broker must be reloaded or restarted in order
  to use that OpenSSH key for authentication.

(RQ #14109)
- Windows: Secure file transfer speed may be slower against Tectia
  Server on Windows than against Tectia Server on Linux.

(RQ #13377)
- Windows: If multiple concurrent terminal services sessions are opened for
  the same user, the services sessions share the same Connection Broker
  session. This can cause the user banner and dialog boxes to be displayed to
  the wrong session. Opening several concurrent terminal services sessions for
  the same user does not provide secure separation of sessions.

(RQ #11836)
- All platforms: After changing the password on a Secure Shell server, but
  before logging in with the new password, either the Connection Broker must be
  restarted to close the previous connection, or the user must wait for the
  connection to time out (by default 5 seconds). If this is not done, login
  with the new password will not succeed.
